This repo constains my code along with utils and tensorflow given module.
This code uses tensorflow lite to detect and count number of people at an evm booth. If this number exceeds 1, a buzzer goes off and email is sent to the person in charge along with an image from the booth.

To run this, user needs a RPi, a webcam and needs to create their own app password on gmail account. User also needs to create a virtual enviornment before running the code.
